_Base template for transversal projects in the AI Engineering Career Program — 4Geeks Academy._

> _Instrucciones disponibles en español en [README.es.md](./README.es.md)._

---

## Purpose

This repository is the **starter template** for transversal projects. You will work on real company scenarios (Brasaland, TrackFlow, Nexova), building deliverables that map to course milestones (Web, Programming, Backend, Telemetry, RAG, Agents, Workflows, Real-time).

- Use the consolidated Brasaland context and specifications linked below as the project's sources of truth.
- Use `skills/` and the directory-level `README.md` files as working guidance.

---

## Current status

This workspace is configured for Brasaland. The canonical company/domain context and consolidated project requirements live in [`docs/brasaland/contexto-maestro.md`](./docs/brasaland/contexto-maestro.md) and [`docs/brasaland/especificaciones-maestro.md`](./docs/brasaland/especificaciones-maestro.md). The root `CONTEXT.md` is retained as a protected legacy reference; do not treat it as the canonical source for new work.

## Background tasks

Docker Compose runs Redis as the Celery broker, an independent `rfp-worker`, and Flower at `http://127.0.0.1:5555`. Start the stack with `docker compose up --build`; stop it with `docker compose down`. The RFP draft endpoint returns a `task_id`, and authenticated clients can poll `/tasks/{task_id}`. Apply `services/brasaland-api/migrations/005_create_task_dead_letters.sql` before production use.

## How to start

1. **Use this repository as a template** and create your own project repo.
2. **Clone** your repository (or open it in Codespaces).
3. **Read** the canonical company context and specification register linked above before implementing a milestone.
4. **Review** each top-level folder `README.md` to understand intended responsibilities (`uis/`, `services/`, `data/`, `skills/`, etc.).
5. **Start implementing** milestone deliverables in the appropriate folders, reusing existing packages and pipelines where possible.
